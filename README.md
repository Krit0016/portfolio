# My Web Portfolio
This portfolio website was created as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. Here is an overview of the process of creating this website:

## Process
- **Research:** I began by researching marget and target, other web portfolio to get ideas and inspiration for the design and layout.
- **Design:** I created wireframes and prototypes using AdobeXD to plan the layout and structure of the website.
- **Initial Documents and Folders:** I started with an initial folder structure to keep my files organized and created documents to help plan the content and layout of each page.
- **Image Organization:** I filled the images folder with all the planned pictures and organized them into folders. I also formatted the images into minimum two sizes for optimal loading time and display.
- **Coding for General Style:** I created the general style of the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework.

## Challenges
During development, I faced a few challenges such as:

- **Learning Bootstrap Framework:** I had to spend some time learning how to use Bootstrap effectively to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Meeting Accessibility Standards:** I realized at some point that I had missed out on some accessibility standards, so I had to go back and make necessary changes.
- **Creating a contact form that sends emails directly to my inbox:** I had to learn how to use PHP to create a contact form that sends emails directly to my email.

## Lessons Learned
Through creating this web portfolio, I have learned the importance of:

- **Planning and Organization:** Having a plan and an organized folder structure is crucial to keeping everything in order and avoiding confusion.
- **Continued Learning:** The world of web development is constantly evolving, and there is always something new to learn. Continuously updating skills and knowledge is vital to staying relevant in the industry.

## Assets and Resources
I used various assets and resources to create this web portfolio, including:

- **Frameworks:** I used the Bootstrap framework for the design and layout of the website.
- **CSS Libraries:** I used Font Awesome for icons and Animista for animations.
- **Fonts:** I used the Google Font "Averia Serif Libre" for headings and "Poppins" for body text.
- **Images:** I used a background image from Pexels, which can be found [here](https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-cloudy-sky-6662557/)
- **Animations:** I used animations from Lottiefiles for the flying birds, which can be found [here](https://lottiefiles.com/124864-flying-bird), and the working woman, which can be found [here](https://lottiefiles.com/122259-working-woman).

Through this web portfolio, I was able to present my work in a visually appealing and accessible manner while also gaining valuable experience in web development.
