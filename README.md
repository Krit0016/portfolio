# My Web Portfolio
This portfolio website was created as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. Here is an overview of the process of creating this website:

## Process
- **Research:** I began by researching marget and target, other web portfolio to get ideas and inspiration for the design and layout.
- **Design:** I created wireframes and prototypes using AdobeXD to plan the layout and structure of the website.
- **Initial Documents and Folders:** I started with an initial folder structure to keep my files organized and created documents to help plan the content and layout of each page.
- **Image Organization:** I filled the images folder with all the planned pictures and organized them into folders. I also formatted the images into minimum two sizes for optimal loading time and display.
- **Coding for General Style:** I created the general style of the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework.

## Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the development process, several challenges were faced, including:

- **Bootstrap Framework:** The use of the Bootstrap framework was new and presented a steep learning curve. Solution: To overcome this, extensive research was conducted and Bootstrap tutorials were followed to help in understanding and using the framework effectively.
- **Accessibility Standards:** Ensuring the site met accessibility standards was overlooked initially. Solution: To overcome this, tools like WAVE were used to test for accessibility and guidelines were followed to make necessary changes.
- **Contact Form:** The contact form needed to send messages directly to my email address. Solution: Research was conducted to find a suitable and secure way to make the contact form send messages directly to my email address.
